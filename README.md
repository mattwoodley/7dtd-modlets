# 7dtd-modlets
All of my 7 Days To Die video-game modlets in one place.

These are called modlets as they are designed to fit with the vanilla code of the game, so that there shouldn't be any corrupted files for when the game does update. 

This way, players won't have to re-download the game and modlets may still work without the need to be rewritten.
