		<Name value="Hunting Rifle Headshot Passive Buff" />
		<Description value="This adds a passive buff to the hunting rifle that is always active. Upon a player hitting a headshot, the reload speed is increased by 150% for the next reload. This was added to help the Hunting Rifle stay relevant with the other rifles, as the Marksman Rifle and Sniper Rifle outclass the Hunting Rifle easily in vanilla." />
