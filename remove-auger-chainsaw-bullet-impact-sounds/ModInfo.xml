		<Name value="Remove Impact Sound of Bullets, Augers and Chainsaws on Blocks" />
		<Description value="A19 introduced impact noises for the augur and chainsaw.
                            It is deafening and isn't remotely appropriate to the action.
                            This modlet removes that noise but as a consequence, all bullet impact noises are removed as well.
                            Fortunately this only effects bullets that miss zombies, which you probably wouldn't notice anyway.
                            Why bullets would be put together with the chainsaw and augur is beyond me.
                            I assume it will be fixed in the future as it surely can't be intentional." />
